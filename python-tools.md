## Autoformatter
Why using auto formatters?

[Autoformatters for Python](https://www.kevinpeters.net/auto-formatters-for-python):
> - You do not need a style guide for low-level problems since the auto formatter deals with those problems
> - This directly reduces the number of discussions about unnecessary things and let the developers focus on writing actual code
> - It will also help with onboarding developers on the codebase because the style of the code is consistent
> - Fewer merge conflicts since the style will almost always be the same
