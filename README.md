# Python Learning Resources

These notes were made while teaching programing for beginners in Python. The resources are not structured as a tutorial but by topic, and they might be a good starting point for you.

## IDE

The IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is fancy name for a *Code Editor* plus tools that makes you productive. There are penty out there and this is my short list:

- [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)

## Python Tools

### Autoformatter
Why using auto formatters?

[Autoformatters for Python](https://www.kevinpeters.net/auto-formatters-for-python):
> - You do not need a style guide for low-level problems since the auto formatter deals with those problems
> - This directly reduces the number of discussions about unnecessary things and let the developers focus on writing actual code
> - It will also help with onboarding developers on the codebase because the style of the code is consistent
> - Fewer merge conflicts since the style will almost always be the same
